        <p>I'm originally from <u>Aberystwyth</u>, Wales, and now based in Glasgow.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm studying Professional Software Development at <u>CodeClan</u>. I'm new to programming but am thoroughly enjoying the challenge and creative thinking required.</p>
        <p>Long-distance backpacking is a real passion of mine - in 2017 I hiked <u>Te Araroa</u>, hiking the entire length of New Zealand - over 3000km. I've walked a few other long trails as well since then, including the Cambrian Way and the Hebridean Way.</p>
        <p>One of the main reasons I moved up to Scotland back in 2017 was to enjoy <u>the great outdoors</u>. I'm slowly working my way through the Munros and Corbetts whenever the weather allows!</p>
        <p><u>I love reading</u>. Mainly history, non-fiction and some fantasy here and there. I'm a big George R. R. Martin fan.</p>
        <p>If it's a rainy day and I'm not out walking, I would probably be want to be at home, <u>cooking and listening to music</u>, enjoying a coffee.</p>
